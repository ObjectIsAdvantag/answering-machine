# Goal

A #golang Answering Machine backed by Cisco Tropo Communication Services 


# Implementation

[X] back-end API structure
   - args, version, glog
   - healthcheck
   - error structure
   - v0.1

[X] MVP with a Cisco Tropo's communication backend (Call/Voice/Recording)
   - golang encapsulation of the Tropo Web API (Session, Record, Say)  
   - provisioning env (registration, phone number) via Tropo REST API (see postman collection)
   - local tests via localtunnel 
   - v0.2

[ ] Add end-user Experience
    - recordings persistance to Bolt
    - API to browse recordings
    
[ ] Add Notification
   - TBD : Slack, Cisco Spark

[ ] Hosting on a public cloud 
   - TBD : Google, Amazon
   
[ ] Enhancements
   - Secure Recorder via BasicAuth
   - Enhance Trop encapsulation (Voices)
   
[ ] Experiment hosting to Cisco shipped
   - TODO : resolve issue via drone.yaml 


# Bootstrapping 

## Take your dev hat and ...

1. From Tropo.com, create a developper account.

   Note : Your login/password credentials are used to authenticate against the Tropo API via BasicAuth
   
2. [optional] Try the Tropo provisioning Postman collection

   - start or install postman
   - load the "Tropo provisonning test suite" collection : https://www.getpostman.com/collections/78022a95468b8ef01de9
   - create an environnement, and add the tropo_key variable with value Basic XXXXXXXXXX= (your base64 encrypted HTTP credentials)
   - run the Test suite
   
3. Register the answering machine

   - start or install postman
   - load the "Answering Machine" collection : https://www.getpostman.com/collections/682f3c9f46d74e7ed85f
   - create an environnement, and add the tropo_key variable with value Basic XXXXXXXXXX= (your base64 encrypted HTTP credentials)
   - run the Provision commands
   - go to the environment to retreive your phone number
   - note :you may also connect to the Tropo portal and check your application has been created

4. Test the answering machine service against your local env 

In a terminal, run localtunnel

```
> npm install -g localtunnel
note : a go version also exists, see https://github.com/NoahShen/gotunnelme

> lt --port 8080 --subdomain answeringmachine
your url is: https://answeringmachine.localtunnel.me
```

In another terminal, launch the service 
```
> make dev 
or
> go build .
> ./answering-machine.exe -logtostderr=true -v=5
```

In a third terminal, or postman, call the answering machine healthcheck endpoint
```
> curl -v -X GET https://answeringmachine.localtunnel.me/ping
```
