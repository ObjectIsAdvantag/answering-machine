# Goal

A #GOLang Answering Machine backed by Cisco Tropo Communication Services 


# How to use it

1. Download the answering machine binaries from [releases](https://github.com/ObjectIsAdvantag/answering-machine/releases)
   - or git clone and build your own (make all)

2. Signup at http://tropo.com
   - Note : Your login/password credentials will be used to authenticate against the Tropo REST API (provisonning) 

3. Register your app
   - Either via the [POSTMAN collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/682f3c9f46d74e7ed85f) or via the provision script
   - /!\ Write down your brand new Answering Machine phone number

4. Update config.json with your personal data


5. If your host is not visible on the internet, install localtunnel

``` bash
      > npm install -g localtunnel
      > lt -p 8080 -d mygolam
```

6. Launch your answering machine (& the recorder if you choose not to register your recordings at tropo)
   - WINDOWS > make run
   - LINUX : TODO
   - DOCKER: TODO


7. Call your answering machine and leave a message

> make dev 
or
> go build .
> ./answering-machine.exe -logtostderr=true -v=5
```

In a third terminal, or postman, call the answering machine healthcheck endpoint
